Data and scripts used in Brachypodium stacei ECI genome research

The v2 version was used in the population genetic analysis.
The v2.1 version reversed some chromosomes sequence compared to v2, in order to maintain consistency with the chromosome sequence direction (to avoid reverse complement) of the reference genome ABR114. 

v2 and v2.1 have same assembly length and gene sequence, the gene coordinates in v2.1 gff was also reversed.
