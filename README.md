Data and scripts used in Brachypodium stacei ECI genome research

The v2 version was used in the population genetic analysis.
The v2.1 version reversed some chromosomes sequence compared to v2, to maintain consistency with the chromosome order of the reference genome ABR114. v2.1 was utilized for transcriptomic analysis.

v2 and v2.1 have same assembly length and gene sequence, the gene coordinates in v2.1 gff was also reversed.
